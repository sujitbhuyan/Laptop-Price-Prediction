# Laptop-Price-Prediction
The laptop price predictor is a regression model that aims to predict the price of a laptop based on various features such as the laptop's brand, model, processor, graphics card, storage capacity, and other specifications. The model is built using a regression algorithm that analyzes the relationships between the laptop's features and its price, and then uses that information to make predictions about the price of new laptops. The end result is a tool that can help consumers make informed decisions about which laptops to purchase based on their budget and desired features.
